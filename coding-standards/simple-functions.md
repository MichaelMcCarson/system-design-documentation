# Simple Functions

## Functions Do One Thing

One function must do only one thing. If a function is doing more than one thing, the function should be split up into more functions.

For further clarity, see [Designing Good Functions](https://workat.tech/machine-coding/tutorial/design-good-functions-classes-clean-code-86h68awn9c7q#:~:text=A%20function%20should%20do%20one,doing%20more%20than%20one%20thing.)

A good mnemonic to remember is the Unix Philosophy:
[DOTADIW: Do One Thing and Do It Well â€” Unix philosophy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unix_philosophy#Do_One_Thing_and_Do_It_Well)

## Small Functions

The first rule of writing functions is functions should be small. The second rule for writing functions is that they should be even smaller. Functions that have 200 or 300 lines are kind of messy functions. They should not be longer than 20 lines and mostly less than 10 lines. Functions should have as few parameters as possible. Small functions are easy to understand and their intention is clear.
